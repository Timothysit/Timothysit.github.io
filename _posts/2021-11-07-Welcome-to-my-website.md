title: Welcome to my website
---

Hello, welcome to my website that is currently under slow but active construction. This page will eventually contain an overview of the contents of the website, which is likely to include 30% neuroscience, 30% general coding / mathematics / data analysis musings and 40% other personal interests such as board games, data visualisation and attempts to decipher cantonese pop song lyrics.

I expect out of all the people who stumbled upon this website, 30% will be new professional acquitances who want to know my about my work, and 20% will be colleagues/friends who just spontaneously felt to look me up. In both cases, my github page and google scholar page will suffice for now, also feel free to ask how my PhD is going and expect to see a funny expression on my face. There's also the about me page [here](https://timothysit.github.io/about/) which I am working on. 40% will be people thinking about applying / applying to the SWC PhD programme or thinking about joining the Carandini-Harris lab, in which case feel free to email me and about the programme / labs. The final 10% will be some random samples from (mainly the neuroscience side of) twitter and github and there is a non-zero chance of a prospective employer reading this in which case please stop now as the website is not polished yet, forget everything you've read here!
